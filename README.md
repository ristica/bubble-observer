# bubble-observer
use of observer pattern on bubblung events

well, if you have an structure (just like a piramyd) wher root has, let's say, 3 children and every one of them (these 3 children) has another 3 children, and so on...

imagine that for some reason an update is happened on 2nd level's chilren and the parent of the updated child needs to know what happened with one of its children...

if that is teh case - then thi bubble-observer may help you :-)
